# Entra Explorer

Entra Explorer is an open-source solution that leverages Microsoft
Graph to help administrators retrieve and visualize data from
Microsoft Entra.

## Solution Overview

The solution is a single-page application (SPA) hosted on GitHub Pages,
built with Next.js (a React framework) and styled using Microsoft&apos;s
Fluent UI. It leverages the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for
authentication, with all Microsoft Graph requests handled on the client
side.
